        <p>
          I live and work in the UK and am currently helping people find jobs they'll love a bit easier by making the frontend of <a href="http://www.myjobmatcher.com">MyJobMatcher.com</a> as awesome to use as possible. I'm insterested in modern functional Javascript development. My current favorite stack would include <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node</a>. My other main interest is calisthenics.
