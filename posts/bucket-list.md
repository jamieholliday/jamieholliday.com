My last birthday was one of the bigger ones. 40 years old. While I wasn't
particulary sad at turning 40 it did make be think about all the things I'd
accomplished so far and about how I thought I may have achieved a few other
goals by this age.

With that in mind I got thinking about the next 10 year block and how I could
make that as enjoyable, productive and fulfilling as possible.

I decidied to compose a bucket list, normally a list of things you hope to do in
your lifetime, instead this one would be limited to 100 items and a timeframe of
10 years.

I figured that if I knock off all 100 things on this list I'm going to have some
good stories to talk about on my 50th birthday.

Super simple maths - 100 items in ten years is 10 per year so aprox 1 a month
with a couple months left out.

Some of the items are much harder/larger than others and will take a whole bunch
of effort to achieve. Some can probably be batched up a few at a time etc, some
are simple things that maybe easy to achieve but for whatever reason I've no
goten around to completing them thus far.
